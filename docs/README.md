## Sunergy

> A cross-platform deep-learning framework.

## What is it

Sunergy is a deep-learning framework. It's written in purely C so it can out-of-the-box get compiled for many different platforms. Sunergy is designed in a flexible way that by defining different structures, different algorithms and models can be implemented. Sunergy also comes with interfaces to many programming languages. See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) for more details.

## Features

* Written in C
* Constructing deep models be defining structures and specifying weights
* Optimized for Linux, Windows, iOS, Android
* Optimized for GPU and CPU
* Interface to C/C++ and Python

## Examples

* [Object detection](det.md)
* [Multi-object tracking](mot.md)
* [Pose estimation](pose.md)
* [Face attribute prediction](face.md)
* [Cross-camera Re-Id](reid.md)
